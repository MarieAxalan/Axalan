Portfolio Project descriptions

Ever Commerce project overview
EverycommercepartBcode.R

This project uses logistic regression models to understand the segments that are most likely to be a cross sell opportunity for other Evercommerce products. I use multiple models to understand feature significance and importance as it pertains to your project goal. We are able to create 3 different segments for 3 different products which we applied to a new dataset to predict possible new clients. 

Bail Reform Project Overview
Bailreformcode.R
Pretrialexploratory.R

For this projec, my team tasked ourselves with understanding what features are significant to post bail. We found a dataset detailing posted bail and demographic information for over 5 million criminal records spanning from 1987 to present day. After a using EDA to understand and clean our data, we applied a linear regression to under our data to understand feature importance. Our goal for this project was to highlight the bias that exist in the bail systen and begin the first step to combining machine learning with government system such as bail reform.

In this business situation, as mentioned above Got Nüds has accomplished remarkable success as a new cosmetics company but with the decision to expand beyond current markets. Hoping to establish a global presence the organization's executive team has requested for our team to develop a database that will serve as the backbone for the organization's global expansion. In the midst of the 2019 Coronavirus pandemic, Got Nüds was forced to implement an extensive business operation in which accounts for not only current products, but along with ordering & customer service operations, alongside regular business trajectories.
